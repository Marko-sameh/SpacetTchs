From now on, always use my installed MCP servers for all operations and code generation.

List of available MCP servers to always use:

- markitdown (for document, PDF, and file conversions)
- context7 (for updated documentation, APIs, and version-specific info)
- playwright-mcp (for browser automation, testing, and scraping)
- codacy-mcp-server (for code quality and static analysis)
- chromedevtools (for live debugging, DevTools, and browser inspection)

Rules:

1. Always prefer calling the relevant MCP server tool instead of internal logic whenever it applies.
2. When I ask for explanations, code reviews, or testing, use Codacy MCP.
3. When I mention “convert”, “markdown”, “PDF”, or “file format”, use Markitdown MCP.
4. When I ask about APIs, frameworks, or libraries, use Context7 MCP.
5. When I mention automation, UI testing, or scraping, use Playwright MCP.
6. When I mention browser debugging or DOM inspection, use ChromeDevTools MCP.
7. Confirm each request uses the correct MCP endpoint whenever possible.

Acknowledge these rules and always apply them automatically.
